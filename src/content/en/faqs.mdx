**What is the value and purpose of the UTXO Stack token?**

UTXO Stack will issue a utility token based on the RGB++ protocol, with the following main uses:

- **Early Incentives**: Tokens will be used to incentivize nodes, liquidity providers, and overall network activities in the early stages.
- **Liquidity Staking**: Nodes must stake a certain proportion of tokens to obtain liquidity from the pool.
- **Penalty Mechanism**: If a node is found to be inactive, its liquidity will be forcibly withdrawn, and the staked tokens will be confiscated as a penalty.
- **Revenue Distribution**: 80% of the transaction fee income of nodes will be returned to the liquidity pool and distributed as dividends to liquidity token holders.
- **Fee Allocation**: The remaining 20% of transaction fees will be allocated proportionally, with 50% used as node income and the other 50% used for protocol revenue.
- **Asset Type Voting**: Token holders can vote to decide which assets can enter the Decentralized Liquidity Staking Pool (DLSP).
- **Community Governance**: Token holders can participate in community governance and provide suggestions and influence for future decisions.
