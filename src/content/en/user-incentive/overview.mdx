# Overview

Welcome to the UTXO Stack [User Incentive Event](https://www.utxostack.network/airdrop)! This initiative is designed to encourage active participation in the Lightning Network ecosystem by rewarding users with points that can be exchanged for tokens in the future. Our goal is to foster a vibrant community of users who are engaged in the development and expansion of the Lightning Network.

## Event Objectives

- **Encourage Adoption**: Promote the use of the Lightning Network by providing incentives for users to open channels, make transactions, and invite others.
- **Build Community**: Create a supportive environment where users can learn, share, and grow together.
- **Reward Engagement**: Offer tangible rewards for active participation, helping users to see the value of their contributions.

Please note that this event is not yet open to the public. But now you can start using JoyID Lightning Wallet and prepare for the event.

By participating in the UTXO Stack User Incentive Event, you are not only earning rewards but also contributing to the growth and success of the Lightning Network. We are excited to have you on this journey with us!
