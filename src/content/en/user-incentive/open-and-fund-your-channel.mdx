# Open and Fund Your Lightning Channel

Ready to start using the Lightning Network? First, you'll need to open and fund your channel. Your initial funding automatically opens your Lightning channel and determines its capacity - this is important because you cannot add more funds to the channel later. So please choose your funding amount carefully based on your expected transaction needs.

In this guide, we will walk through the complete funding process and help you choose the best method for your needs.

<Callout type="info">
**Important to Know**:
- Your first funding automatically creates and opens your channel
- The amount you fund determines your maximum channel capacity and your maximum transaction size. Channel capacity currently cannot be increased after initial funding
